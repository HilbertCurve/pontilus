An OpenGL program has shaders, vertex buffers, a window, a camera, mouse/keyboard callbacks, 
and the rest of the program logic. 

OpenGL:
 | DONE ;; Application.cpp - inits everything / sets up a window / sets up callbacks
 | TODO -- Camera.cpp - camera
 | DONE ;; Renderer.cpp - renders stuff
 | DONE ;; Shader.cpp - handles getting shader data
 | TODO -- Texture.cpp - textures, when that becomes necessary
 | TODO -- InputListener.cpp - mouse and keyboard callbacks/data
Application:
 | ...?
 | 
 | 
Things To Do:
 | DONE ;; Get renderer chugging out things
 | TODO -- Do github stuffs
